- 👋 Hi, I’m @1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 (Nik Heneralov)
- 👀 I’m interested in all, especially programming, math, music, science, physics, biology, chemistry, psycology etc. Also: people's behaviour in different situations, in interests, in the people's meaning, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ~the course of chemistry (made as for by uni programs) in 10 days, by Catherine E. Hausecroft, Edwin C. Constable ("Chemistry An Integrated Approach")~ math and the<strike> modern</strike> theory of chess. OK, also --- programming. I am also interested in learing languages. Planning to learn the Idish, and few tonal. From Ukraine himself, but just a person.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on life.
